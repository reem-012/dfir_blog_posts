# Attack Surfaces and Trust Boundaries: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction
### What are Attack Surfaces?
An attack surface comprises all points where a user (or another system) can interact with your application. Anything that can be interacted with can potentially be attacked. In cybersecurity, our job is to protect these attack vectors and identify which ones pose the highest risk.

An attack vector can be:
- An API endpoint
- A web form
- A login page
- Database connections
- User input fields
- Authentication mechanisms
- File upload functionality
- Session management endpoints

### What are Trust Boundaries?
Trust boundaries are points in a system where the level of access privilege changes. These are locations where data transfers across a network interface or passes from one process to another. The reason you identify trust boundaries is that they represent possible points of failure where a malicious attacker could potentially escalate their privileges or perform unintended actions.

Types of trust boundaries:

- **External to Internal**: This is the boundary from the untrusted internet to an organization's internal network
- **Perimeter to Core**: This is the boundary from publicly facing endpoints to endpoints that reside deeper inside the organization's private network
- **Application to Database**: This is the boundary between the application layer and the database layer. This can be a form of perimeter to core boundary
- **Application to Third-Party Service**: This is the boundary between an organization's internal application and a third-party service 
- **Different User Privilege Levels**: This is the boundary between users with different access rights within the same system

## Understanding Attack Surfaces
### Theoretical Foundation
As described earlier, an attack surface is any point in a system that can be leveraged by an attacker to gain access to your system. An attack surface can be categorized into components and types. Components are the fundamental ways an attack surface can be categorized based on the nature of vulnerability or interaction. Types are specific domains or areas where these vulnerabilities can manifest. These are more granular and specific.

- **Types describe the specific domains or areas of potential attack**

#### Components of an Attack Surface
##### Physical Attack Surface
The physical attack surface comprises physical hardware such as workstations, mobile devices, and external storage media like hard drives. The physical attack surface can be exploited by insider attacks, poor disposal, poor physical security, as well as unpatched operating systems and applications. The way you reduce your physical attack surface is by implementing physical access controls such as pin pads, having device management solutions in place such as an MDM, and ensuring that you are following proper hardware disposal practices.

##### Digital Attack Surface
The digital attack surface is the attack surface of all hardware and software exposed to your internal network. This can include code, servers, applications, as well as shadow IT. This is a very complex attack surface to try and protect due to how fast the underlying technologies change compared to the physical attack surface. The way that you reduce your digital attack surface is by continuous scanning for misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, implementing zero trust architectures, segmentation, and KISS (keeping it simple, stupid).

##### Social Attack Surface
One part that is overlooked in a system is the actual operators of a system. Humans are incredibly susceptible to social engineering. Through tools like phishing and social engineering, attackers are able to use legitimate privileges given to users to abuse a system. This is a tricky attack surface to mitigate due to the human element. Effective techniques for mitigating this attack surface would include user training, zero trust architecture, heuristic analysis systems (such as an IPS or IDS or EDR/XDR tooling).

#### Types of Attack Surfaces

- **Network**: This includes hardware like routers and switches but also includes the layer 7 protocols running on devices.
- **Application**: This is software in use by an organization (either internal or third-party)
- **Endpoint**: These are devices that connect to the network like workstations and mobile devices
- **Human**: These are the operators of a system and can often be the weakest link in a system
- **Physical**: This is the physical hardware in a system such as building security or servers
- **Cloud**: This includes data and infrastructure that is stored and hosted by cloud providers
- **Supply Chain**: The supply chain can include how hardware is procured or less tangible things such as what software dependencies an organization is using in their internal applications
- **Wireless**: This includes Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, NFC
- **IoT Devices**: IoT (Internet of Things) devices are their own type of attack surface due to the nature of how different they are from other attack surfaces

### Attack Surface Mapping
#### Techniques
Mapping an attack surface is challenging and can be unique to each organization due to how each org uses IT in the environment. There are three ways to map attack surfaces:

##### Manual Analysis
Manual analysis requires you to perform an asset inventory review with tools such as a CMDB or an asset discovery tool. You can also perform network topology mapping with a tool such as Nmap. You may use these tools to identify any shadow IT that exists in your environment.

So this is all well and good for the physical attack surface, but how do you perform manual analysis of your digital attack surface? This could include analyzing your Software Bill of Materials (SBOM). It could involve interviewing subject matter experts (SMEs) for various applications as well as performing code analysis of source code, especially relating to crucial components of an application such as authentication or user inputs.

##### Automated Tools
Automated mapping is specific to the type of attack surface you are trying to analyze. Tools such as Tenable Nessus or endpoint management systems like Tanium, Intune, and NinjaOne are all incredibly useful for gaining an understanding of what endpoints are in your environment and if there are any vulnerabilities present on them. You can also use a tool such as Tenable to map your network and infrastructure.

For the application attack surface, you would want to employ both SAST and DAST tooling in various parts of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
- **SAST**: SAST stands for Static Application Security Testing. These are tools that look at your source code and attempt to identify vulnerabilities. There is open-source tooling that performs very specific functions. An example could be Trufflehog that looks for hardcoded secrets inside repositories or a tool such as Semgrep that does a semantic grep for potential vulnerabilities in your code. You can also use more advanced tools such as Snyk and SonarQube that have the ability to do code analysis, check for code smells, and check for vulnerabilities with dependencies.
- **DAST**: DAST stands for Dynamic Application Security Testing. These are tools that test an application while it's running for common vulnerabilities, and these can exist in many parts of the SDLC. These could include implementing tools such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite into your pipeline so that applications get tested dynamically before any code is actually deployed. This could also include having a set of Web Application Scanners (WAS) such as Tenable Web Application Scanning or Qualys Web Application Scanning.

##### Threat Modeling Approaches
You can use threat modeling approaches to better understand your attack surface and understand where your trust boundaries lie. There are many different threat models that serve their different purposes.

| Methodology | Summary | Use Case |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| STRIDE | The STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, and Elevation of Privilege) threat modeling methodology is a structured approach for identifying potential security vulnerabilities in systems or applications. | Best used in software design phases to identify specific threat types in applications or protocols. |
| PASTA | PASTA stands for Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis. It's a 7-stage risk-centric methodology focused on simulating attacks to evaluate business impact. | Ideal for aligning technical threats with business impact in complex or high-risk systems. |
| LINDDUN | LINDDUN is a privacy threat modeling framework focused on analyzing threats related to data privacy (Linkability, Identifiability, Non-repudiation, Detectability, Disclosure, Unawareness, and Non-compliance). | Best for systems that handle sensitive personal data and must comply with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). |
| Attack Trees | A visual, hierarchical diagram-based method for modeling threats where the goal (attack) is at the root and branches represent different paths an attacker could take. | Useful for brainstorming and visualizing multiple attack strategies against a system or process. |
| VAST | The Visual, Agile, and Simple Threat (VAST) modeling methodology aims to integrate seamlessly into agile SDLCs with automation and scalability. | Ideal for large enterprises with agile teams needing scalable, dev-friendly threat modeling at both app and infrastructure levels. |

## Conclusion
Understanding attack surfaces and trust boundaries is foundational to designing secure systems. By categorizing your environment into distinct surface types—physical, digital, social, and more—you gain clarity on where vulnerabilities exist and how they can be exploited. Recognizing trust boundaries allows you to identify where privilege transitions occur, which are often the prime targets for attackers seeking escalation paths.

Effective security strategy starts with visibility. Whether you use manual asset discovery, automated scanners, or structured threat modeling, the goal is the same: reduce the unknowns. Attackers thrive on ambiguity; defenders succeed with clarity.

As environments grow more complex with cloud adoption, containerization, and third-party integrations, your attack surface expands. Make mapping and evaluating that surface a continuous process—not a one-time checklist.

By combining tooling, human insight, and structured methodology, you can make informed decisions about where to invest your security efforts. And more importantly, you can draw your system's boundaries before an attacker does.
